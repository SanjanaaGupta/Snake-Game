# Snake-Game
It is a Snake Game Using Core Java Concepts and Object Oriented Programming (Oops)

The Java Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game project implemented in Java. The game simulates the timeless entertainment of controlling a snake as it maneuvers around a bounded area, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collision with itself and the walls.

Key Features:

Snake Movement: The game allows players to control the movement of a snake using arrow keys (or other specified controls). The snake moves continuously in the direction indicated by the player until redirected or until it collides with an obstacle.

Food Generation: The game randomly generates food items within the playable area. When the snake consumes a food item, it grows longer, increasing the player's score.

Snake Growth: As the snake consumes food, its length increases. The player's objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with any obstacles.

Collision Detection: The game features collision detection mechanisms to detect collisions between the snake and the walls of the playable area, as well as collisions with the snake's own body. Collisions result in the end of the game.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with its own body. 

Graphics and User Interface: The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) displaying the snake, food items, and game boundaries. Visual elements are designed to enhance the gaming experience.

This Java Snake Game project aims to provide an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience while showcasing fundamental concepts of game development, including input handling, game logic, collision detection, and user interface design, all implemented in Java.
